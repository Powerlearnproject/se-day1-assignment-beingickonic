# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality softwer systems.
Involves software product design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1.The Waterfall Model -  It emphasizes a sequential design process where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
    2.The Agile Manifesto - A set of principles for software development that prioritize customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software over strict adherence to processes 
      and tools.
    3.Software Engineering - Was organized to address the growing complexity of software systems and the need for more structured approaches to software development.

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1.Analysis - This phase involves collecting and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders to define the software's requirements.
 2.System Design - Defining the systemâ€™s architecture, data models, interface designs, and algorithms.
 3.Implementation - It involves translating the design documents into executable code and integrating various software components. 
 4.Testing - This phase involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, to ensure that the software meets the requirements and functions correctly.
 5.Deployment - This phase involves installing the software on the target systems, configuring it for use, and making it available to end-users.
 6.Maintenance and Support - This phase ensures the software continues to function correctly, remains relevant, and adapts to changing requirements or environments.
  

4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
